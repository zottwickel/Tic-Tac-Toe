This is a ruby-based, console running game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

Open a terminal in the containing directory and(if you have ruby installed) type "irb tictactoe.rb" to play!

NOTES:
Maybe switching the board for an object and the spaces for variables will shorten the code.

Seems like it could be utilized with a GUI of some sort in the future, rather than in the command line.
